# Reading Notes 3 Course 401

## Reading and writing files in Python

A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data.

- The data is stored in a specific format
- Can be as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable
- Bytes are translated into binary code to be processed by the computer

Files on a computer are composed of 3 main parts

1. Header: Metadata about the contents of the file

2. Data: Contents of the file as written by the creator/editor

3. End of File (EOF): Special character that indicated the end of the file

__*File Paths*__

A file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Its broken up into 3 parts

1. Folder path
2. File Name
3. Extention

__*Line Endings*__

A common problem when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending across different operating systems. This makes it difficult to iterate over each line

__*Character Encodings*__

Another common problem is the encoding of the byte data. If you parse a file using an incorrect character encoding, there will be a misrepresentation of characters

__*Opening and Closing a file in Python*__

- When opening a file you invoke the open() built in function
- After opening a file you must also properly close it using close() built in function
- Alternatively you may use "with open()" to automatically close the file after it has been opened

__*Types of files*__

1. Text file
2. Buffered Binary file 
3. Raw file

__*Reading/Writing open files*__

After opening a file you may read and write to the file. 

- .read(size=-1) - Reads file based on number of size bytes.(If None or -1 are passed then the entire file is read)

- .readline(size=-1) - Reads a line (If None or -1 are passed then the entire line or rest of the line is read)

- .readlines() - Reads the remaining lines from a file and returns them as a list

- .write(string) - Writes the string to a file

- .writelines(seq) - Writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended and must be done manually

__*Working with Bytes*__

Sometimes you work on files with byte strings

- Done by adding 'b' character to the mode argument

- Will allow you to read the bytes individually (examine contents)

__*dos2unix.py*__

Code that will convert a file containing the line endings of \r\n to \n

__*file*__

- __file__ returns the path relative to where the initial python script was called

- The path name of a file from which a module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file

__*Appending to a file*__

To append to a file, or start writing at the end of an already populated file, you use the 'a' character for the mode argument

__*Creating your own context manager*__

When you use __enter__() and __exit__() you have created a context manager.

- You create this in a class

- Once created, that class is a context manager, and you can use it similarly to open()

## Exceptions in Python

__*Exceptions vs Syntax errors*__

- Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement

- Exception errors occur whenever syntactically correct python code results in an error

__*Raising an Exception*__

You may use "raise" to throw an exception if a condition occurs

> raise Exception("string".format(x))

__*AssertionError Exception*__

Instead of waiting for a program to crash, you can make an assertion

- If the condition is true, then the program will continue
- If the condition is false, then the program will throw an assertion error

An example of this is if a user runs a windows os on a program that is only compatible with linux

__*try and except block*__

When syntactically correct code runs into an error, python will throw an exception error, and then crash if it is unhandled. To deal with this you may use the try and except block

- Try will run code, and test or any errors

- Except will tell your program how to respond to exceptions

- When an exception occurs in a program, running an except will continue the program, as well as inform you that the function call was not successful

__*Else clause*__

Using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code in the absence of exceptions

__*Finally*__

A piece of code that always runs at the end, even if you encounter an exceptio somewhere in the try or else clauses.

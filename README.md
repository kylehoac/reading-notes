# Growth Mindset
When you are in a growth mindset, it puts you in a headspace where you can push yourself to learn new things, and accept that failure is a part of the learning experience. This mindset is essential for success in every field of work, and allows you to overcome any obstacles that may be in your way. 

## How do you maintain a growth mindset?
- Stay positive
- Learn from your mistakes (failure is the greatest teacher)
- Encourage asking for help, and turning to others for answers

## About Me

My name is Kyle Hoac, and I am currently an aspiring software developer studying with Code Fellows. I was previously employed in the sales industry, however the pandemic gave me an opportunity to explore other career paths. You can view more of my work on my [Github profile](https://github.com/kylehoac).

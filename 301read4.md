# Reading Notes 4 Course 301

__*Forms in React*__

In react, forms elements will keep some internal state

- Form submit buttons have a default behavior of navigating to a new page when a user submits a form

- Its recommended to a javascript function that handles the submission using "controlled components"

__*Controlled Components*__

- In Html forms will maintain their own state until changed by the user

- In react, the react state becomes the single source of truth, and the render component will control what happens on submission

- ^ This allows you to pass the value to other elements, or reset it from other handlers

__*Text area tag*__

- In React < textarea > defines its text using the "value" attribute

- The value should be initialized in the constructor so that the form starts out with text

__*Select Tag*__

-To have an option of a dropdown menu selected you use the value attribute, and initialize it the constructor

- Instead of using the selected attribute, React will use a value atribute on the root select tag

__*File input tag*__

- The file input tag is an uncontrolled component because its value is read only

__*Handling Multiple Inputs*__

- To handle multiple controlled input elements, you add a name attribute to each element

- The handler function will be able to choose what to do based on the value of the selected element attribute

__*Controlled Input Null Value*__

- Specifying the value prop of a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless told otherwise

- If a value is specified but the input is still editable, then it may come back as null

__*Pages in Nextjs*__

A page is a React component exported from a file in the pages directory

- To create a page, you need to create a js file under the 'pages' directory and the path to the file will become a url path

__*Navigating Pages*__

To link between pages you use the < a > tag

- With Nextjs you use the 'Link' component from 'next/link' to wrap the a tag

- Link allows client side navigation to a different page in the application

> import Link from 'next/link'

Example:

```
<h1 className="title">
  Read{' '}
  <Link href="/posts/first-post">
    <a>this page!</a>
  </Link>
</h1>
```

__*Client Side Navigation*__

Using Link allows for clientside navigation, meaning that all of the page transition happens using JavaScript instead of the browser (faster than browser navigation)

- Nextjs does code splitting automatically so that each page only loads whats necessary for that page

__*Image Component / Optimization*__

`next/image` is an extention of the html img tag, that allows for image optimization, allowing for resizing, optimization and serving images in modern formats

__*MetaData*__

`Head` is an extention that allows for modification of the head html tag

> import Head from `next/head`

__*Layout Component*__

A layout component is shared across all pages

```
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

- When used in other components, it will give the layout components class names that look like `layout_container__...`

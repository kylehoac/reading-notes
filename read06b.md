__*How do computers work?*__

Computers were built to store and manipulate information. They need to be able to perform the following 4 tasks:

- Take input
- Store information
- Process it
- Output the results

Input

- Gives the computer commands

Storage

- Takes the input information, and stores it into memory.

Processing

The processor takes information from the memory, manipulates it using an algorithm, then sends the information back to be stored again, until its ready to be output

Output

- A computer may output information in a variety of ways such as text, photos, videos, games, VR, and signals to robots
*The output of one computer becomes the input to another and vice-versa*

__*Binary, and Data*__

- The inside of a computer consists of electric wires, and circuits that carry all of the information in a computer. The wires can be on or off (T/F, Y,N, 1,0). This is known as a bit (smallest amount of info a computer can store). More wires = more bits = more complex information

__*Binary number system*__

- Binary number system only has 2 digits (0 and 1)
- Instead of multiplying each number by 10 like the decimal system, you multiply by 2
- Any number can be represented by 1's or 0's ( the more wires the more numbers you can store )
- Numbers can also be used to represent text, images, and sound

__*Circuits and Logic*__

- Every input and output is information represented by on or off
- A circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it. The circuit will always be the opposite of the signal it flips.
- There are many small circuits that perform simple logical calculations, and connecting the circuits will make more complex circuits making more complex calculations
- Smaller circuits are faster because there is less of a distance for electric circuits to go

__*Hardware and Software*__

- Everything physical in a computer is hardware
- Software can be anything from Apps, games, websites, etc.
- The CPU contols all of the other parts of the computer
- Binary is the most basic form of software, and controls all of the hardware in the computer
- The OS is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware on a computer

## JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token defines a compact and self contained way for securely transmitting info between parties as a JSON object

Signed Tokens - Verify the integrity of the claims contained within it
Encrypted Token - Hide claims from other parties

__*Uses for JSON Web Tokens*__

Authorization: Once a user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing users to acces routes/services permitted to that user

Information Exchange: A way of securely transmitting information between parties

__*JSON Web Token Structure*__

JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts seperated by dots/periods

- Header - Consists of two parts, the type of token, and the signing algorithm being used (then it is 'Based64Url' encoded)
```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

- Payload - Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity, and additional data. The 3 types of claims are registered claims(predefined claims), public claims(Defined by those using JWT's), and private claims(custom claims for sharing information) (Encoded by Based64Url)

```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

- Signature - Takes the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm to sign it

Typically looks like:

> xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

__*How JSON Web Tokens work*__

When a user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token is returned

- Since tokens are credentials you must make sure to make them secure
- When a user wants to access a protected route, the user will send the JWT
- The JWT is given to the user by exchanging a username + password for an access token + refresh token

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQzODI4NDMxLCJqdGkiOiI3ZjU5OTdiNzE1MGQ0NjU3OWRjMmI0OTE2NzA5N2U3YiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.Ju70kdcaHKn1Qaz8H42zrOYk0Jx9kIckTn9Xx7vhikY'
```

Access Token - Usually short lived(expires in about 5 min , and can be customized)
Refresh Token - Lives for about 24 hours. After it expires the user must provide a username and password again

__*Obtaining Tokens*__

1. Authenticate and obtain the token (Endpoint is /api/token/ and it only accepts POST requests)
2. Obtain and store the access token and refresh token on the client side (usually in local storage)
3. In order to access restricted views, your access tokens should be included in the header of all requests

- You can use an access token for 5 minutes
- After 5 minutes you will use your refresh token to gain a new access token
- Refresh tokens are needed to make sure a user still has correct permissions throughout extended periods of time

## Production Server

__*Production Stack*__

Production setup - consists of multiple components, each individually designed to be good at one thing (fast, reliable, and focused)

- When a request is received by your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server
- Web servers are used to pass requests to the application server
- Application servers are used to construct Python objects which are usable by Django (WSGI Server)
- Django apps are designed to call your code, and produce a response object which is passed to the WSGI server

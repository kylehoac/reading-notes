__*SQL vs NoSQL High Level Differences*__

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases, NoSQLs database are primarily called non-relational or distributed database.
- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled using hardware whereas NoSQL will use more servers
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

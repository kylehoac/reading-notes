## Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures that are made up of a collection of vertices/nodes connected by lines called edges

__*Graph terminology*__

1. Vertex - A vertex or node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
2. Edge - Connection between two nodes
3. Neighbor - A vertexes adjacent vertices
4. Degree - A degree is the number of edges connected to a vertex

__*Undirected vs. directed graphs*__

*Undirected Graph* - A graph where each edge is undirected meaning that it does not move in any direction (no directions given to point to another vertices)

*Directed Graph* - A graph where each edge is directed (each node is specifically directed to another node)

__*Complete, Connected, and Disconnected graphs*__

*Complete* - When all nodes are connected to all other nodes

*Connected* -Each node has at least one edge

*Disconnected* -Some vertices may not have edges

__*Acyclic vs Cyclic*__

*Acyclic* - A directed graph without cycles

*Cyclic* - A defined path of positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex

__*Graph Representation*__

*Adjacency Matrix* - Represented through a 2d array (if there are n vertices then the matrix is n * n)

*Adjacency List* - Represented by a collection of linked lists or arrays

*Weighted Graphs* - A graph with numbers assignes to its edges, called weights

__*Graph traversal*__

*Breadth First* - start at a specific node, and visit all nodes that are closest to the root as possible. While traversing, keep a visited variable, which will let the program know to not visit that node again (preventing infinite loops in cyclic graphs)

Steps to breadth first traversal:

1. Enqueue the start node into a queue
2. Create a loop that will run while nodes are present
3. Dequeue the first node
4. If the dequeued node has unvisited child nodes, add them to the viseted set and insert those nodes into the queue

Ex:
```
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
```

- If there are any disconnected nodes with the graph structure they wont be traversed
- Breadth first only outputs the nodes that are connected in some relation to the root passed in

*Depth First*

Depth first uses a stack in order to traverse. It will check the roots first unvisited child, and then proceed to check if the first unvisited child has any child nodes before looking at the roots remain unvisited child/children

Depth first algorithm:

- Push root node into the stack
- Start a while loop for while the stack is not empty
- Peek at the top node in the stack
- If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top as visited, and push the unvisited children into the stack
- If the top node does not have unvisited children, pop that node off the stack
- repeat until the stack is empty

## Forms

An html form is a group of one or more fields on a web page that can be used to collect information from users/submit to a surver

- Forms allow you to send data in POST requests with cross site request forgery protection

__*HTML Forms*__

HTML forms are a colection of elements inside of the < form > tags. The submit button will send user data to the server

- The server checks if all of the data being submitted is valid, and once they are will perform an appropriate action

Djangos form handling does the following:

1. Display the default form for the first time when requested by the user
2. Receive data from a submit request and binds it to the form
3. Clean and validate the data
4. If any data is invalid, redisplay the form with error messages for invalid fields
5. If all data is valid, perform required actions
6. Redirect to another page after completion

__*Declaring a form*__

Declaring a form is similar to declaring a model:

```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```

- There are different types of form fields to dictate the type of form information

__*Validation*__

The easiest way to validate a single field s to use the clean_< fieldname >() method

__*View*__

The view will render the form and must be able to distinguish between the first time it was called, and every other time after that (whether its valid, or invalid information)

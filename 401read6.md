## How to use the Random Module

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations.

- One of the most important things it can do is generate random numbers

__*Common Uses*__

- Pick a random number in a given range
- Pick a random element from a list
- Pick a random card from a deck
- Flip a coin
- Making your password database more secure
- Powering a random page feature of a website

__*Random Functions*__

- Randint - Accepts 2 parameters of a lowest and a highest number

> random.randint(0,5)

- Random - For larger numbers you can multiply the random function

> random.random() * 100

- Choice - For choosing a random element from a list

> random.choice(['red', 'black', 'green'])
> or random.choice(list)

- Shuffle - Shuffles elements in list in place giving them a random order

> x = [[i] for i in range(10)
>> shuffle(x)

- Randrange - Generates a randomly selected element from range. It takes the parameters start, step, stop

> random.randrange(start, stop[, step])

## Risk Analysis

The probably of any unwanted incedent is a "Risk"

- Risk analysis - The process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test

__*Why use Risk Analysis*__

- It highlights potential problem areas
- After identifying problem areas it helps devs mitigate the risk
- When a "test plan" is created, risks involved in testing the product are considered

List of common risks encountered

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

Unavoidable Risks

1. The time allocated for testing
2. Defect leakage due to complexity/size of application
3. Client urgency
4. Incomplete requirements

Ways to handle risks

- Conduct risk assessment meetings
- Utilize maximum resources on high risk areas
- Create a Risk Assessment database
- Identify risk magnitude indicators

Risk Magnitude Indicators

- High - Effect of risk is high and non-tolerable
- Medium - Tolerable but not desireable
- Low - Tolerable

__*Risk Identification*__

1. Business Risks
2. Testing Risks
3. Premature Release Risk
4. Software Risk

__*Risk Assessment*__

1. Early forecast of risk in your project
2. Estimate potential loss of the situation
3. Make decision to deal with risk
4. Avoid future consequences

__*Perspectives of Risk Assessment*__

- Effect - Assess risk by effect. Identify condition, event or action and try to determine impact
- Cause - Assess risk by cause. Scan the problem, and reach to the point where you find the most probable reason behind it
- Likelihood - Asses risk by likelihood. When there is a probability that a requirement wont be satisfied

__*Performing Risk Analysis*__

1. Search for the risk
2. Analyze impact of risk
3. Take measures towards the identified risk

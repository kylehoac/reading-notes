# Reading Notes 4 Course 401

__*Classes and Objects*__

- Objects - An encapsulation of variables and functions in 1 entity. They get those variables/functions from Classes

- Classes - Template to create your object

- You can access an objects variable by using dot notation, and the name of the variable

- Functions are similar, and se dot notation to access them inside of an object

__*Thinking Recursively*__

- Breaking down a problem into smaller chunks is thinking recursively

- Python programs use recursive functions and recursive data structures

__*Recursive Functions in Python*__

- A recursive function is a function that calls itself via self-referential expressions

- This means that the function can cal itself and repeat its behavior until a condition is met to return a result

Recursive functions are made up of

1. A base case

2. A recursive case

__*Maintaining State*__

A recursive function has to call its own execution context. To main state you must either

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the most recent call execution

- Keep the state in a global scope

__*Recursive Data Structures in Python*__

- A data structure is recursive if it can be defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.

- The recursive functions structure can be modeled after the definition of the recursive data structure it takes as an input

__*Pytest Fixtures and Coverage*__

- Fixtures - Objects that are available to all of your tests in a test suite

- Fixtures are used differently from global variables. They will be mentioned in the parameters and accessed from inside the test

- Fixtures are basically functions under the hood, and will execute every time you invoke a test using that fixture

- Code Coverage ensures that your tests are running all of the code

- This doesn't mean that the code is perfect or bugproof but helps ensure a greater degree of confidence in the code

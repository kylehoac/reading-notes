## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods are a special set of predefined methods that are used to enrich your classes (ex: `__init__` and `__str__`)

__*Python data model*__

Python data model is an API you can interface with by using dunder methods

__*Different Dunder methods*__

Object Initialization: `__init__`: To construct objects in a class (constructor that creates object from a specific class)

Object Representation: `__str__, __repr__`: To provide a string representation of your object

- `__repr__`: The official string representation of an object (meant to be unambiguous)

- `__str__`: The nicely printable string representation of an object

Iteration: `__len__, __getitem__, __reversed__`: To iterate over an object

Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: `__eq__, __lt__`: Used for comparing integers, strings, and other objects as long as they're the same type

Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: `__add__`: Allows for adding or concatenating objects together

Callable Python Objects: `__call__`: Makes an object callable like a regular function

Context Manager Support and the With Statement: `__enter__, __exit__`: Allows for use of context managers

```
A context manager is a simple “protocol” (or interface) that your object needs to follow so it can be used with the with statement. Basically all you need to do is add __enter__ and __exit__ methods to an object if you want it to function as a context manager.
```

## Iterators

Iterators provide an interface that allows you to process every element of a container while being isolated from the containers internal structure

```
Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops `ex: for x in value` (The two methods work together to make the object iterator)
```
__*For-in loop behind the scenes*__

```
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```

- It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its `__iter__` method. This returned the actual iterator object.

- After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator object’s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.

## Generators

With generators you can write a simple iterator faster

This:

```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```

Turns into this:

```
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```

- Instead of using `return` generators use `yield` to pass data back to the caller
- Calling a generator function does not run the function, it creates and returns a generator object
- Code only executes when `next()` is called on the generator object

__*Return vs Yield*__

- When a return statement is invoked inside of a function, it permanently passes control back to the caller of the function

- When a yield is invoked, it only passes control back to the caller of the function temporarily

__*Python generators that stop generating*__

You can manually end an iteration by raising a `StopIteration` exception:

```
    def __next__(self):
        if self.count >= self.max_repeats:
            raise StopIteration
        self.count += 1
        return self.value
```

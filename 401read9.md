__*Dunder Methods*__

Dunder methods are a special set of predefined methods in Python that you can use to enrich classes

- You create a dunder method using double underscores

> \__init__ or \__str__

__*Object Initialization*__

\__init__ - Takes care of setting up an object. Works similar to a constructor function
__*Object Representation*__

\__repr__ - The official string representation of an object

\__str__ - The informal/ nicely printable string representation of an object

__*Iteration*__

\__len__ - Will grab a length of anything that is considered iterable

\__getitem__ - Will grab a specific item

\__reversed__ - Will iterate backwards

__*Operator Overloading*__

\__add__ - Will concatenate or add things together, and will behave differently depending on the data type

__*Callable Python Objects*__

\__call___ - Makes an object callable like a regular function

## Probability

__*What is probability*__

Answers the question of "What are the chances of an event happening".

- An event is an outcome of interest
- To calculate the chance of an event happening, you need to consider all the other events that can occur
- Computer programs allow us to find the probability of an event happening much quicker than if it was done manually

__*Normal Distribution Factors*__

- Central Limit Theorem - Lets us know that the average of many trials menas will approach the true mean

- Three Sigma Rule - Dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three

- Z-Score - Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean

## Regex in Python

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text or not

- To start using regex you must start by importing "re"

A few useful functions provided by the re library include:

- compile()
- search()
- findall()
- sub() - for search and replace
- split()

__*Ordinary Characters*__

Ordinary characters are the most simple regular expressions

- They will match themselves exactly (has no special meaning in their regex syntax)
- Ex: 'A', 'a','X','5'
- match() - Will return a match object if the text matches the pattern. (Else it will return None)
- Using 'r' will change a string into a raw string literal
- Ex: \ is a regular backslash when prefixed with r rather than being used as an escape

__*Special Characters*__

Special characters are characters that do not match themselves but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression

search() - Scan through the given string or sequence, and look for the first location where the regular expression produces a match

group() - Returns he string matched by the regular expression


__*Grouping*__

Grouping in regular expressions allows you to pick up parts of the matching text

- To bound regex patterns together you use ()

- You can also use <> to create named groups

> Syntax : (?P< name >...)

__*Greedy Vs. Non-Greedy Matching*__

Greedy Match - Special characters that mach as much of the search sequence as possible (normal regex behavior)

Non Greedy Match - Using ? after a qualifier. Makes performing the match non-greedy/ in minimal fashion

## Matching Table

. - Matches any single character except the newline character

^ - Matches the start of a string

$ - Matches the end of a string

[abc] - Matches a or b or c

[a-zA-Z0-9] - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9)

\ - Any character prefixed by a backslash loses its special meaning

\w - Matches any single letter, digit or underscore

\W - Matches any character not part of \w

\s - Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return

\S - Matches any character not part of \s

\d - Matches decimal digit 0-9

\D - Matches any character that is not a decimal digit

\+ - Used for repitition. Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position

\t - Matches tab

\n - Matches new line

\r - Matches return

\A - Matches only at the start of the string (Will work across multiple lines)

\Z - Matches only the end of a string

\b - Matches only the beginning or end of a word

\* - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times from that position

? - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or one time starting from that position

{} - Checks for an explicit number of times

{x} - Repeat exactly x number of times

{x,} - Repeat at least x times or more

{x, y} - Repeat at least x times but no more than y times

() - Bind regular expression patterns together

<> - Binds regex expressions and allows names

__*Re Functions*__

compile() - When you need to use an expression multiple times in a program. Will save the resulting regex object for reuse

search() - scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match (MATCHES ANYWHERE IN THE STRING)

match() - Returns a match object if zero or more characters at the beginning of the string match the pattern (ONLY MATCHES BEGINNING OF STRING)

findall() - Finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings

finditer() - finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns regex match objects as an iterator

sub() / subn() - Substitute function that retuns the string obtained by replacing the leftmost occurences of a patter in a string. Subn() will return a tuple containing the new string value, and number of replacements

split() - splits the strings wherever a pattern matches and returns a list

start() - Returns the starting index of the match

end() - Returns the index where the match ends

span() - Return a tuple containing the start, and end positions of the match.

__*Compilation Flags*__

Ignorecase (I) - Allows case-insensitive matches.

Dotall (S) - Allows . to match any character, including newline.

Multiline(M) - Allows start of string (^) and end of string ($) anchor to match newlines as well.

Verbose (X) - Allows you to write whitespace and comments within a regular expression

## Shutil

Shutil is a module that includes high level operations like copying and archiving

__*Copying Files*__

copyfile() - copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it doesnt have permission to write to the destination file

copy() - interprets the output name like the command line tool cp. If it refers to a directory instead of a file, a new file is created in the directory using the name of the source

copy2() -  works like copy() but includes the access and modification times in the metadata copied to the new file

copymode() - Copys permissions from one file to another

copystat() - Copys other metadata about a file

__*Directory tree functions*__

copytree() - Recurses through the source directory tree and copies files to the destination

ignore_patterns() - creates an ignore function to skip copying Python source files

verbose_copy() - prints the names of files as they are copied then uses copy2() to make the copies

rmtree() - Removes a directories content

move() - Move a file or directory from one place to another

__*Finding Files*__

which() - scans a search path looking for a named file

make_archive() - Creates a new archive file

__*File System Space*__
disk_usage() - returns a tuple with the total space, the amount currently being used, and the amount remaining free.

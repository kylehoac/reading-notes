__*Pain and Suffering (nice)*__

- All growth comes from some degree of pain as it pulls you out of your comfort zone

Throughout the course consider

1. Whats your perspective?
2. Why are you doing this?
3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
4. Are you doing this for you?

__*Big O Notation*__

Used in computer science to describe the performance/complexity of an algorith.

- Specifically describes the worst case scenario
- Can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm

__**O(1)**__

Describes an algorithm that will always execute at the same time or space, regardless of the size of the input data set

__*O(N)__
Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

__*O(NÂ²)*__
Describes an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. (Common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set)

__*O(2^N)*__
Denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve is exponential

__*Logarithms*__

A type of algorithm (O(log N)) that does iterative halving of data sets

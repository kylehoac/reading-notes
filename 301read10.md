## Call Stack JS

A call stack is a data structure that uses Last in first out principle to store and manage a function invocation

- LIFO - The last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first one to come out

- When a function is called it its parameters, and variables are pushed into the "call stack"

- The call stack will clear it when the function return

- The call stack has a record of the position of each stack frame, and knows the next function to be executed. This makes the code execution "synchronous"

__*Stack Overflow*__

A stack overflow occurs when there is a function that calls itself without an exit point (recursive function)

## Error Message Debugging

Reference Errors
> Trying to use a variable that is not declared yet
>> Solved by: Declaring a variable before any declaration is made

Syntax Errors
> Occurs when something cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
>> Solved by: Fixing syntax

Range Errors
> Trying to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length
>> Solved by: giving manipulated object a valid length

Type Errors
> When the data type you are trying to access is incompatible
>> Make sure the variable is declared correctly(Data type)

__*Debugging*__
The easiest way to debug is using a console.log(), or opening up developer tools, choosing the line of code you want to debug, and refresh your page

Other debugging methods to use are: 

- Breakpoints - Will see what happened before the line of code selected
- Conditional Breakpoints - Will stop at a breakpoint if a condition is met
- Debug Tab (VSC)

- To avoid errors from causing things after it to not be executed, you can use try and catch
- The application will keep running when using try and catch, however there may be side effects

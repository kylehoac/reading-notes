## Stacks and Queues

A stack is a data structure that consists of nodes

- Each node references the next node in the stack but doesnt reference its previous node

__*Stack Terminology*__

1. Push - Nodes that are put into the stack are pushed
2. Pop - Nodes that are removed from the stack are popped
3. Top - Top of the stack
4. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack
5. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false

__*FILO*__
Filo stands for First in last out
 
- The first item in the stack will be the last item popped out

__*LIFO*__

- The last item added to the stack will be the first itep popped out

__*Push*__

When you push a new node into a stack it will become the new top

- This will always be an O(1) operation as it always takes the same amount of time no matter how many nodes are in the stack

__*Pop*__

Removes a node from the top of the stack

- Will remove and reassign the node previous to it, as the top node

- This will always be O(1)

__*Peek*__

Inspects the top node of a stack

- You will usually check isEmpty before conducting a peek to ensure an exception isnt raised

- This is always O(1)

__*isEmpty*__

Checks to see if the stack is empty

- Is always O(1)

__*Queue Terminology*__

1. Enqueue - Nodes that are added to the queue
2. Dequeue - Nodes that are removed from the queue
3. Front - This is the first Node of the queue
4. Rear - This is the last Node of the queue
5. Peek - Will view the value of the front Node in the queue
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false

__*FIFO*__

First in first out 

- Means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue

__*LILO*__

- Means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue

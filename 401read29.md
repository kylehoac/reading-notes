## Django: Custom User Model

Django custom user models are recommended for real word project by the official Django documentation, because they provide far more flexibility

- Always use a custom user model for all new Django projects

To create a new django project you must

- Install Django
- Make a new Django project
- Make a new app
- Start a local web server

__*AbstractUser vs. AbstractBaseUser*__

The 2 ways to create a custom user model are AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser

- AbstractBaseUser requires much more work and should only be used if you have extensive experience
- AbstractUser subclasses AbstractBaseUser and provides more default configuration

__*Custom User Model*__
Creating initial custom user requires the following steps:

- update config/settings.py
- create a new CustomUser model
- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
- update the admin

To create a custom user model you must use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell django to use a new user model

- You must add AUTH_USER_MODEL to the INSTALLED_APPS file under accounts
- You then must update projects/models.py with the new user model, and make migrations

## DjangoX Setup

> (djangox) $ python manage.py migrate

Create a Superuser
> (djangox) $ python manage.py createsuperuser

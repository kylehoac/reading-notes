## Unit tests and TDD

Unit tests are pieces of code that exercise the input, output, and behavior of the code. You can write them anytime you want

TDD (Test driven development) is a strategy to thing and write tests first

__*Unit tests*__

- The test name should be descriptive and say what is expected, and what it is testing

- The test file should follow the same name as the module name

> ex: name.py and test_name.py

- It is ideal to seperate the test code from the production code in files

A convention that is widely used for the structure is AAA: Arrange, Act, and Assert

- Arrange - Organize the data needed to execute the piece of input

- Act - Execute the code being tested

- Assert - Check if the result is what you were expecting

__*TDD Cycle*__

- ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail

- âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass

- ðŸ”µ Refactor the code

## Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion. The corresponding function is called a recursive funtion.

- n can have multiple values
- Memory for different function calls in recursion are allocated to the "stack"
- When a recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is allocated on top of stack, and a different copy of local variables is created for each function call
- When the base of the stack is reached, the function returns its value

# Growth Mindset

When you are in a growth mindset, you are in a headspace where you can push yourself to learn new things, and accept that __*failure is a part of the learning experience*__. This mindset is essential for success in every field of work, as it allows you to overcome any obstacle that you may come across rather than giving up, or deciding that you aren't the right person for the job. Furthermore, adopting a growth mindset will prove to be beneficial if applied to your personal life as well. It will teach you to overcome adversity, and overtime will give you the skills needed to find or create solutions to any problem you may face.

## How do you maintain a growth mindset?

- Stay positive
- Learn from your mistakes (failure is the greatest teacher)
- Encourage asking for help, and turning to others for answers

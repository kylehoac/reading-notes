## Images

__*Controlling Size*__

- To  control the size of an image in CSS you can use the width and height elements

__*Aligning Images*__

- To align images you can use the float property, (or flexbox)

Float will use right, and left to push images to either side

Since images are inline elements by default, you need to turn them into block elements to center them. Some ways include
> changing the img element to a block element, and using the text-align: center; rule on its containing element
>> Change the margins on the image itself

__*Background Images*__

You can set an image as a background using :

> background-img: url("imageurl") ;

To repeat the background vertically, horizontally, or both you can use:

> background-repeat: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat (non repeating)
>> You can also set a background-attachment to either scroll or fixed to determine how it acts on the pae

To set the backgrounds position you can use the background-position property followed by:
> left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, etc.

__*Image Rollover*__

You may change the style of a link or button when it is hovered over, and clicked using image rollover

- This is done by setting a background iage for a link or button that has three different styles of the same button ( but only allowing one of them to have enough space to show at a time)

- When one image is used in multiple different parts of an interface its known as a sprite (useful so the browser only has to render one image rather than multiple images making loading times faster)

__*Practical Info*__

Search Engine Optimization helps users find your webpage when using a browser. This is done by:

- Figuring out which terms users are most likely to enter to make your webpage appear closer to the top.

- The browser will consider both what appears on your site, and what sites are linked to it (on page techniques and off page techniques)

__*On Page Techniques*__
On page techniques consist of looking at keywords that people are likely to enter when looking for your site, and then including them in the text or HTML code of your site.
You can throw keywords into the:

- Page title, URL, Headings, text, link text, image alt text, and page descriptions

__*Analytics*__

You can analyze how users found your site, what they were looking at, and at what point they left when a user enters your site (google analytics)

You can also view how many people are coming to your site, and the analytics of page views and unique visits

__*FTP*__

To transfer code and images from your computer to a web hosting server, you use FTP ( File Transfer Protocol )

There are many free softwares that allow you to do this

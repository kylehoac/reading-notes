## Models

Models define the structure of stored data, including:

- field type
- maximum size
- default values
- selection list options
- help text for documentation
- label text for forms

Models work independently from a database (Django handles communication under the hood)

- When designing models you want to have seperate models for every "object"
- You can also have models represent selection-list options

Models are defined within the applications models.py file

Models contain:

Fields - Represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables

Meta Data - Controls the default ordering of records returned when you query the model type

Methods - Python methods, every model should have a __str__() method to return readable

__*Model Management*__

Creating a record - To create a record you can use save() on an object

Finding a record - To find all models that have records as a queryset, you can use objects.all() on any iterable model object

## Django Admin

Django admin models can use your modelts to automatically build a site area that you use to create,view, update, and delete records

The admin model is also useful for managing data in production

- Django admin models are recommended only for internal data management (admins/people in your organization)

- To add admin models, you must register them, and then create a superuser login for the site

- You log into a website as the admin by opening the sites /admin URL

# Reading Notes 7 Course 401

__*Scope*__

The python scope concept is presented using a rule known as LEGB rule

- The letters stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in

__*Understanding Scope*__

There are 2 general types of scopes

- Global scope: Variables that are available within all of your code
- Local scope: Only available to the code within the scope

You can create Python names through the following operations:

- Assignments
- Import operations
- Function definitions
- Argument definitions in context of functions
- Class definitions

__*Python Scope vs Namespace*__

- Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects (often called namespaces)

- Names at the top level of a module are stored in that modules namespace, and is stored in the modules .\__dict__ attribute
- You can use .keys() to inspect a list of keys in \__dict__
- If you want to access a name you can use dot notation , or use a subscription operation

> sys.ps1 or sys.\__dict__['ps1']

__*LEGB Rule*__

- Local scope - the code block of a python function or lambda expression

- Enclosing / Nonlocal Scope - A special type of scope that exists for nested functions

- Global Scope - Top level scope in a Python program, script, or module

- Built-In Scope - A special Python scope thats created or loaded whenever you run a script or open interactive session

- The LEGB rule is a lookup procedure that determines the order that Python looks up names

## Modifying behavior of Python scope

Python uses two keywords that allow you to modify the content of global and nonlocal names

1. global
2. nonlocal

__*Global Statement*__

With the global statement, you can define a list of names that will be treated as global names

- The statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names seperated by commas
- You can use multiple global statements with a name
- With the global stament, you are telling Python to look in the global scope for a specific name/names, and allowing a function to update it
- Is considered bad practice

__*Nonlocal Statement*__

Nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated

- The Nonlocal statement allows you to update nonlocal names
- With a Nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as Nonlocal
- Consists of the "nonlocal" keyword followed by one or more names seperated by commas (These names refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope)
- You cannot use nonlocal outside of a nested or enclosed function

__*Closure*__

A closure is an inner or nested function that carries information about its enclosing scope, even though this scope has completed its execution

- Provide a way to retain state information between function calls

__*Bringing names to scope with import*__

When code is organized into several modules, you can bring names in by importen them into the \__main__ module.

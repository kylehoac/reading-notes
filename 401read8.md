## List comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists

- Consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, and 0 or more for or if clauses

> new_list = [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

Another way to thing about it is

> *result* = [ *transform* *iteration* *filter* ]

__*Common Uses*__

Creating a simple list
> x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x
>> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Create a list using loops and list comprehension
> squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
>>print squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

Multiplying parts of a list
> list1 = [3,4,5]
>> multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1]
>>> print multiplied = [9,12,15]

__*How to use list comprehension in functions*__

Ex: Create a function and name it double

> def double(x):
>> return x*2

Use list comprehension

> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

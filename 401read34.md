## Django Settings

__*Different configurations*__

*settings_local.py*
This method extends all environment specific settings in the settings_local.py file
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}

...

from .settings_local import *
```
*Separate settings file for eah environment*
An extention of the settings_local.py approach. Allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and share default settings between devs

Settings package file structure:
```
settings/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base.py
   ├── ci.py
   ├── local.py
   ├── staging.py
   ├── production.py
   └── qa.py
```
settings/local.py file:
```
from .base import *


ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

*Environment Variables*
Using Python os.environ (Must handle sharing default config between devs)
```
import os


SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.environ['DATABASE_NAME'],
        'HOST': os.environ['DATABASE_HOST'],
        'PORT': int(os.environ['DATABASE_PORT']),
    }
}
```

__*12 Factors*__

A collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web pages that makes them easy to deploy and scale in the cloud

1. Codebase
2. Dependencies
3. Config
4. Backing services
5. Build, release, run
6. Processes
7. Port binding
8. Concurrency
9. Disposability
10. Dev/prod parity
11. Logs
12. Admin processes

The main rule is to store configuration in the environment in order to maintain a strict seperation from code

__*Django-environ*__

Django-environ helps resolve the need for additional effort to handle errors due to the complexity of os.environ

- It gives a well functioning API for reading values from environment variables or text files, handful type converson, etc.

__*Django settings best practices*__

- Keep settings in environment variables
- Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens)
- Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS
- Split the settings up into groups
- Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings

## SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify remote servers over the internet

- Uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server is encrypted

__*SSH Command*__

> ssh {user}@{host}

SSH key command tells your system that you want to open an encrypted secure shell connection

{user} - The account you want to access
{host} - The computer you want to access (IP address or domain name)

- When you hit enter, you are prompted to enter the password to the requested account. Then hit enter again

__*Different types of encryption*__

*Symmetric Encryption* - A secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and host (also called shared key or shared secret)

- Secret tokens are specified to each SSH session and are generated prior to client authentication

*Asymmetric Encryption* - Uses two seperate keys for encryption and decryption (known as public-private key pair)

- A public key cannot be used to decrypt a private key
- Security relies on private key remaining private

*Hashing*

One-way hashing is used in SSH connections, and are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value at a fixed length for each input, and shows no trend

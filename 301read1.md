# Reading Notes 1 Course 301

__*What is React*__

React is one of the most common libraries you can use in JavaScript, for building user interfaces. It allows ou to compose UI's from pieces of code called components

Components - Used to tell react what we want to see on our screen. When data changes, React can update and re-render the components

- Components can take in parameters called "props"

Render method - Returns a description of what you want to see on the screen ( render will return a React element )

__*JSX*__

- React uses a syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write out the structure

- With JSX you can use  any javascript expression within braces inside JSX.

- Each React element is a JS object that you can store in a variable and pass around in your program

- You can pass a function in as a prop

- After compilation, JSX expressions will become regular JS function calls and evaluate to JS objects

- JSX tags may also contain children

- JSX will escape any values embedded in JSX before rendering them, preventing XSS attacks

__*Props*__

Props are similar to arguments in a function.

- You cannot change a props value unless you set it to a variable and set the variable to a new value

__*State*__

State is data that can change over time in react

Components can have states by setting this.state in their constructors, and will be private to the component it is defined in

__*Controlled Components*__

Components that receive values from another component.

__*Data Changes/Immutability*__

There are two approaches to changing data

1. Mutatable - Directly changing the data's values
2. Immutable - Replace the data with a new copy that has changes

Detecting changes is much easier in immutable objects compared to mutable objects

- Mutable objects directly modify objects so it makes it difficult since the entire tree has to be traversed

- Immutable objects are much easier because there is a copy that can be referenced

- Using the slice() method will create a new copy of whatever it is used on, and will store them in a history making "time travel" easier. 
__*Function Components*__

Function components are a simpler way to write components that only have a render method, and dont have a state

- The function takes a prop as an input and then returns what should be rendered

__*Components and Props 2*__

Components let you split the UI into independent and reusable pieces. Each piece will be thought about in isolation

- Components are similar to JS functions. They will take in a prop as an input, and then return React elements to describe what should appear on screen.

- Components can be represented by a user defined component (meaning that it can have a custom name and doesn't have to represent a DOM tag)

- Props are read only and cannot be modified

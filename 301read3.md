# Reading Notes 3 Course 301

__*Lifting State Up*__

- When several components need to reflect the same changing data, you will often "lift" the shared state up to their closest common ancestor

__*Transforming Lists + Keys*__

- You can use the map() function to take take an array and transform the list

- To render out multiple components you can use the map function and return array items into li's. The ul element will contain the entire array

- Keys are used to identify items that have changed, are added, or are removed


__*Keys*__
Keys should be given to the elements inside of an array ( a string that identifies a list item from its siblings)

- If no keys are provided you can use the index of the array as the key (not recommended as the order of items can change)

- Keys only make sense in the context of the array

- Keys must be unique among siblings

__*Embedding an expression*__

JSX allows any expression to be embedded in curly braces {}. This allows methods to be called inline

__*Spead Operator JS*__

The "Spead Operator" is a syntax used for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or ojects, and speading an array out into function arguments

- To do this you use ellisis ... to expand an iterable object into a list of arguments

> Math.max(1,3,5) // 5    Math.max([1,3,5]) // NaN
>> Math.max(...[1,3,5]) // 5

Spread operator can be used for :

- Copying an array
- Concatenating/combining arrays
- Using math functions
- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list
- Combining objects
- Converting nodelist to an array

NOTE: Spread operator will not work in IE and browsers on old mobile devices. use ".apply"

## What is a text editor?
Text editors are some of the most important software that a software developer can use. They allow you to write and manage the text that is used to create a webpage. In general, the text editor that fits your workflow, or the one that you find the easiest to use will be your best bet, however they also come with loads of different features in each one, so you should test out a wide variety of them to see which one best suits your needs.

### Some important features of text editors include:
- Code complexion
- Syntax Highlighting
- A nice variety of themes
- The ability to choose from a selection of extensions (Plugins for the text editor)
- Emmett (a feature that makes it easier and more efficient to write HTML and CSS)

#### Basic T.E vs Third party T.E vs IDE's
A basic text editor is one that comes with your computer by default (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.). While you can create webpages using basic text editors, they lack the advanced features that Third party, or IDE's offer. Third party options will come with a wide variety of features and plugins that you can use at your disposal, making them easier and more efficient to use. Each third party text editor will come with its own selection of features, which allows the user to find one that caters towards their workflow. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software that combines a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software. This works as an all in one tool, and provides everything you need in one software.

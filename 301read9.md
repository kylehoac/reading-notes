## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of a program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, and avoids changing state and mutable data

__*Pure Functions*__

Pure functions have a strict definition of purity

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments

- It doesn't cause any observable side effects

__*Immutability*__

- .* Recursion is the process of calling itself

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it is created

- To keep your variables immutable you can use recursion*

__*Referential Transparency*__

If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent

> pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

__*First class entities*__

Functions are treated as values and used as data

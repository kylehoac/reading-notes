## OAuth

OAuth is an authentication protocol that describes how unrelated servers and services can allow authenticated access to their assets without sharing the initial related, single logon credential

- OAuth scenarios almost always represent two unrelate sites or services trying to accomplish something on behalf of the user

> Ex: Log onto a website that offers the opportunity to log in using another websites login services
>> Ex 2: Sending cloud stored files to another user via email


__*Authentication and Authorization Flows*__

Authentication:

- Determines whether users are who they claim to be
- Challenges users to validate credentials
- Transmits info through an ID token

Authorization:

- Determines what users can and cannot access
- Verifies whether access is allowed through policies and rules
- Transmits info via access token
